Step 1: Set up your project:

If you haven't already, install Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) on your computer. You can download them from the official website: https://nodejs.org/

Step 2: Create a new Next.js project:

Open your terminal and navigate to the directory where you want to create your project. Then run the following commands:
npx create-next-app deepwallet
cd  deepwallet

Step 3: Create project structure:

Inside your project directory, you will find a basic folder structure. 
Create additional folders and files as needed for organization. Here's a basic structure:
