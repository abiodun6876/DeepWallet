Wallet.js

Wallet.js is a component in the DeepWallet project that manages user wallet functionality.
I used React to create this component since it's a front-end application. React is an excellent choice for building dynamic and interactive web applications.
It uses the useState and useEffect hooks to manage the wallet's state and interactions with the Ethereum network via Web3.js.
To enhance user experience, it automatically connects to the MetaMask wallet, fetches the user's account address and balance, and stores the connected accounts in local storage for future use.
This component provides a user-friendly interface for users to connect their wallet, select network, and manage accounts easily.
ShowTime.js

ShowTime.js is a component in the DeepWallet project that displays the current time and allows users to view how many times they've clicked the "Show Current Time" button.
It utilizes React's state management using the useState hook to maintain the current time and click count.
The component makes use of the useEffect hook to update the time every second and track the component's render count.
The "Show Current Time" button triggers an update to the click count, demonstrating the interaction between user interface and state.
This component is designed for demonstration purposes and showcases the capabilities of React in managing dynamic content and user interactions.
MouseTracker.js

MouseTracker.js is a component that tracks the mouse cursor's position and dynamically changes the background color based on the mouse's position.
This component also utilizes React and state management through the useState hook.
The onMouseMove event handler updates the position state based on mouse movement.
To calculate the background color, the component uses the window.innerWidth and window.innerHeight properties, which provide the width and height of the browser window, respectively.
The component demonstrates how React can be used to create interactive components that respond to user actions, in this case, the mouse's position.
TextAnalysis.js

TextAnalysis.js is a component that allows users to enter text and analyzes it to find consecutive characters that appear the maximum number of times.
Similar to other components, it relies on React and state management using the useState hook.
The handleTextChange function updates the input text and triggers the analysis.
The findMaxConsecutiveCharacters function processes the text to find the most consecutive characters.
This component serves as an example of a user interface that takes user input and performs a specific operation, showing how React can manage dynamic content and calculations based on user input.
ArrayPairFinder.js

ArrayPairFinder.js is a component that finds pairs of numbers in an array whose sum equals a target value.
The component uses React and state management via the useState hook.
The core functionality is implemented in the findPairs function, which finds all unique pairs that sum up to the target value.
This component is a more complex example that demonstrates how React can manage complex data processing and filtering, providing an array of arrays containing pairs of numbers.
In summary, each component in the DeepWallet project showcases different aspects of React and how it can be used to build dynamic, interactive user interfaces. React's hooks, including useState and useEffect, play a pivotal role in managing state and interactions within each component, making it a suitable choice for modern web development.
