The task description outlines several features to implement in a ReactJs/NextJs frontend application. Below are the steps and explanations for each of the features:

1. Connect the wallet:

You will need to implement a way for users to connect their wallet (Metamask, Polkadot-Js, or any other wallet).
Display the public address chosen in the wallet on the front end.
Display the balance of the address on the selected network (mainnet/testnet/local network).
2. Create a "show current time" component:

Make a React component with a button labeled "show current time."
Upon clicking the button, display the current time.
Console log the number of times the button is clicked.
Display the number of times the component is rendering because of the button clicks.
3. Change background color based on mouse position:

Implement a feature that changes the background color of the page based on the position of the mouse.
You can choose a different shade of green as per your creative preference. You might want to use event listeners to track the mouse position.
4. Collect and analyze input text:

Create an input box where users can enter text.
Implement JavaScript logic to analyze the input text.
Console log the character(s) that appear the maximum number of times consecutively and display them. For example, if the input is "abccdakcee," it should console log "c, e: 2" because characters 'c' and 'e' appeared the most consecutively (2 times).
5. Find pairs of numbers:

Implement a function that takes an array of integers and a target value as input.
The function should find all pairs of numbers in the array whose sum equals the target value.
Each pair should appear only once in the output array.
The function should not use the same element twice to form a pair (e.g., [3, 4] and [4, 3] are not valid pairs).
The order of the pairs in the output array does not matter.
If there are no pairs that add up to the target value, return an empty array.
